# To-Do

- [ ] Make the FS actually read-only <https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/issues/553>
- [ ] Parse `uid` and `gid` options and use them as the default UID/GID
- [ ] Add an option to decrypt every time instead of saving it
- [ ] Expose client UI for plugins to allow interactivity
- [ ] Factor out `allow_others` (and maybe other mount options) into their own options
