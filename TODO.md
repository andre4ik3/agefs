# To-Do

- [x] Make the FS actually read-only <https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse/issues/553>
- [ ] Parse `uid` and `gid` options and use them as the default UID/GID
- [x] Add an option to decrypt every time instead of saving it
- [ ] Expose client UI for plugins to allow interactivity
- [x] Factor out `allow_others` (and maybe other mount options) into their own options
- [ ] Separate out agefs compatibility
- [x] Allow disabling waiting for agefs
